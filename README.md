# hierarchical-multilabel-classifier
## Hierarchical multi-label classifier for news media articles in Croatian language

The project is the product of R&D on the topic of hierarchical multi-label text classification.
I have researched about multiple approaches on extracting features and classifying text, experimented with a few (including BERT, MLP, CNN), made comparisons and valuable conclusions.

The project was implemented as a part of my master's thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.
